# Shitcode for Robot Dreams 2024
## Main info:
- To run this code you need to have instaled C#, C++ and Python compilers. I have instaled python, also C# is on my Microsoft Visual Studio. But for C++ I instaled MinGW, specifically g++. (https://youtu.be/2bZfdWCMBMI) - tutorial to instal this if you need.
- When you instaled MinGW there can be some troubles with dlls files. I added them to repository and you need to copy them into C:\...\MinGW\bin\ . Also into C:\...\MinGW\mingw32\bin\ .
And for sure into C:\...\MinGW\
- As you can notice, there is a little bit of c++ code, and to run it fully in one line is imposible (for my knoledges) due to "#include ..." line.
So near this line is "\n", but when you execute main program you not see any other files except Program.cs
- I created it by Visual studio code. And such files as .sln and .csproj should be ignored by moderators of competition.

## Task
This code tells you if your number is palindrom or not.

## Properties
- It is one line shitcode. Whit length 969 characters.
- Firstly, it is C# code.
- But secondly, a loop part is C++ code.
- And at the end, a print result part is python code.

Have fun!
